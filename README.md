# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

  We use machine learning to predict bad loans. Ideally, this could be used at the application stage, to avoid issuing loans that are likely to default. The current analysis relies on repayment data, such as the amount of the most recent payment, so it can only be used to predict loans turning bad in the near future. Column names are too opaque to clealy distinguish between data available at issuance and later, e.g. repayment, data; so we cannot rerun the analysis to obtain the more important predictions.
